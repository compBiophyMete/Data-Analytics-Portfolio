**Situation:**

I conducted an analysis on an employee dataset sourced from Kaggle under the CC9: Public Domain license with a usability rating of 9.41. The dataset, containing 4653 rows and 9 columns, provides comprehensive information on employees, including educational backgrounds, work history, demographics, and employment-related factors. It has been anonymized to ensure privacy.

**Task:**

The objective was to address specific issues within the dataset, including the gender distribution, distribution of educational qualifications among employees, educational qualifications by gender, the number of recruited employees over the years, the correlation between payment tier and experience, and any patterns in leave-taking behavior.

**Action:**

The dataset was investigated for the presence of null and duplicate values. Then, it was analyzed to unravel

- gender distribution,
- educational qualifications,
- recruitment trends,
- correlation between experience in the current domain and payment tier,
- leave-taking patterns.

**Results:**

- In the company, male employees constitute 59.70%, while female employees account for 40.30%, indicating a prevalence of male employees.
- The majority of employees (3601) hold a BSc degree, with 873 and 179 employees having MSc and PhD degrees, respectively.
- The highest number of employees (1108) was recruited in 2017.
- The Pearson's correlation coefficient between experience in the current domain and payment tier was 0.018, suggesting a lack of correlation. Additionally, no strong correlation was found between leave-taking behavior and joining year (0.18), payment tier (-0.20), age (-0.05), or experience in the domain (-0.03).
- Employees with PhD degrees (25.14%) are less likely to take leave compared to those with MSc (48.80%) and BSc degrees (31.35%). Location-wise, employees in Bangalore (26.71%) are less prone to taking leave compared to New Delhi (31.63%) and Pune (50.39%). Furthermore, 25.77% of males display leave-taking behavior, while 47.15% of females take leave. Employees with temporary tasks (33.13%) are less likely to exhibit leave-taking behavior compared to those without temporary tasks (45.40%).

**Reflection:**

This analysis provides valuable insights into the gender distribution, educational qualifications, recruitment trends, payment-experience correlation, and leave-taking patterns within the company, contributing to a better understanding of employee dynamics and behavior.
