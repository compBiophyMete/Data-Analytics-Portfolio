**Situation:**

The project was initiated to extract and analyze data from a salary survey of developers available on a specific website (Programming Languages Salary Survey). The primary focus was on the "Language" and "Average Annual Salary" columns, with the objective of comparing salaries across different programming languages.

**Task:**

- Web Scraping: The initial task involved extracting data from the website, concentrating on the specified columns.
- Data Processing: Following the extraction, meticulous processing of the obtained data was carried out to ensure its accuracy and relevance.
- CSV File Creation: The processed data was systematically stored in a CSV file, establishing a structured format for future reference.
- Sorting: Programming languages were sorted based on their average annual salaries, resulting in a descending order for clear comparison.
- Visualization: A bar plot was generated to visually highlight the significant differences in average annual salaries among the programming languages.

**Action:**
- Conducted web scraping to extract relevant data using appropriate tools and techniques.
- Processed the scraped data meticulously to maintain data integrity.
- Systematically stored the processed data in a CSV file for organizational purposes.
- Applied sorting algorithms to arrange programming languages based on their average annual salaries.
- Utilized data visualization techniques to create a bar plot for a clear and impactful representation.

**Result:**

The project culminated in the establishment of a distinct order of programming languages based on their average annual salaries: Swift, Python, C++, JavaScript, Java, Go, R, C#, SQL, and PHP. Particularly noteworthy was the observation that Swift offered a significantly higher average annual salary compared to Python and C++, leading to a practical recommendation for early-career developers or recent graduates.
