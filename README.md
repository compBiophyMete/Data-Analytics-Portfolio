# Data Analytics Portfolio

This repository encompasses seven sample data analytics projects showcasing my web scraping, data extraction, cleaning, analysis, and visualization skills.

Python was leveraged in the Project-1, 2, and 3 to analyze datasets. 

IBM Cognos was used to prepare a dashboard for Project-4. 

SQL was utilized in Project-5 & 6. 

SQL was utilized to extract data in Project-7, and subsequently, two dashboards were prepared in Tableau.

For further details of the projects, please go through the README.md of individual projects.
