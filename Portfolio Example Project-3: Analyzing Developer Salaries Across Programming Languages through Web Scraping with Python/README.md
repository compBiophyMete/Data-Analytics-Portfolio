**Analyzing Developer Salaries Across Programming Languages through Web Scraping with Python**

**Situation:**

The project was initiated to extract and analyze data from a salary survey of developers available on a specific website [Programming Languages Salary Survey](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DA0321EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/datasets/Programming_Languages.html/). The primary focus was on the "Language" and "Average Annual Salary" columns, with the objective of comparing salaries across different programming languages.

**Task:**

- Web Scraping
- Data Processing
- CSV File Creation
- Sorting
- Visualization

**Action:**
- Conducted web scraping to extract relevant data using appropriate tools and techniques.
- Processed the scraped data meticulously to maintain data integrity.
- Systematically stored the processed data in a CSV file for organizational purposes.
- Applied sorting algorithms to arrange programming languages based on their average annual salaries.
- Utilized data visualization techniques to create a bar plot for a clear and impactful representation.

**Result:**

The project culminated in the establishment of a distinct order of programming languages based on their average annual salaries: Swift, Python, C++, JavaScript, Java, Go, R, C#, SQL, and PHP. Particularly noteworthy was the observation that Swift offered a significantly higher average annual salary compared to Python and C++, leading to a practical recommendation for early-career developers or recent graduates.

**Reflection:**

This project showcases the ability to extract and analyze data from a real-world survey, providing valuable insights for individuals considering career paths in programming languages.
