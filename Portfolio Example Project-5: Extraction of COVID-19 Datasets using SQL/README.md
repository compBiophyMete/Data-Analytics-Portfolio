**Situation:**

A dataset representing the daily new confirmed COVID-19 deaths per million people between January 28, 2020, and April 30, 2021 were retrieved from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. The dataset was further modified, and two files, 'Covid19deaths.csv' and 'Covidvac.csv', were created. 'Covid19deaths.csv' contains population data and relevant columns, while 'Covidvac.csv' focuses on vaccination data.

**Task:**

The goal was to perform a comprehensive analysis of the 'Covid19deaths.csv' and 'Covidvac.csv' files using SQL. It was aimed to investigate specific points related to COVID-19, such as the percentages of deaths among diagnosed patients in Europe over time, the percentages of deaths in European countries sorted by population percentage, the percentage of infected people in Europe over time, and more.

**Action:**

SQL queries were written to find:
 
1. Percentages of Deaths in Europe Sorted by Date:
2. Percentages of Deaths in European Countries Sorted by Population Percentage:
3. Percentage of Infected People Over Time in Europe Sorted by Location and Date:
4. Percentage of Infected People in European Countries Sorted by Population Percentage:
5. Highest Death and Infection Counts in Countries:
6. Death and Infection Percentages of Continents:
7. Total New Cases, Deaths, and Death Percentage of New Cases Over Time:
8. Time Evolution of Vaccinated People in the Population:

**Result:**

The SQL queries provide detailed insights into various aspects of the COVID-19 data, addressing the specified points of interest. The results can be further analyzed and visualized to gain a deeper understanding of the trends and patterns in the data.
