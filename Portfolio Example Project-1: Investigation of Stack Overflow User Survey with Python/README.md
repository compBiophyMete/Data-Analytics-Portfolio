**Situation:**

In 2019, a comprehensive online survey on Stack Overflow engaged 88,883 users, and the dataset was publicly available under the ODbL: Open Database License.

**Task:**

The objective was to explore various aspects, including gender distribution, respondent age, formal education levels, country-wise respondent counts, and rankings of programming languages, databases, platforms, and web frameworks in both 2019 and expectations for the next year.

**Action:**

The dataset, initially consisting of 88,883 rows and 85 columns. Thirteen relevant columns were chosen for analysis, and 72 columns were discarded. Missing entries in certain columns were addressed through either dropping rows or using imputation methods like mode and mean. Outliers were removed before predicting missing entries in the 'Age' column. The remaining dataset was scrutinized for participant profiles.

The remaining dataset was scrutinized for 

- participant profiles,
- preferences of users in programming languages, databases, platforms, and web frameworks in 2019 and the next year.

**Result:**

- 92.19% of respondents were male, 6.76% identified as women, and 1.05% as non-binary/genderqueer/gender non-conforming.
- The mean age of participants was 29.48, with a standard deviation of 7.18.
- The majority (49.78%) held a BSc degree.
- The top five countries with the most participants were the US, India, the UK, Germany, and Canada.

**Programming Languages:**

In 2019:

- The 10 most popular programming languages were JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL, Java, Python, Bash/Shell/PowerShell, C#, PHP, TypeScript, and C++.

For the next year:

- Python was expected to rise in popularity, with JavaScript and HTML/CSS remaining dominant.
- Changes in rankings were observed, such as Java losing popularity and TypeScript moving up.

**Databases:**

In 2019:

- The top 10 databases were MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, MongoDB, Redis, MariaDB, Oracle, Elasticsearch, and Firebase.

For the next year:

- PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, Redis, and Elasticsearch took the lead, signaling significant shifts in database preferences among developers.

**Platforms:**

In 2019:

- The top 5 platforms were Linux, Windows, Docker, AWS, and Android.

For the next year:

- Linux retained its top position, Docker and AWS switched places, and Windows experienced a decline in popularity.

**Web Frameworks:**

In 2019:

- The top 5 web frameworks were jQuery, React.js, Angular/Angular.js, ASP.NET, and Express.

For the next year:

- React.js emerged as the first-ranked web framework, with changes in the preferences among developers, such as jQuery's decrease in popularity.

**Relection:**

In summary, the investigation highlighted key insights into the demographic and technological landscape of Stack Overflow users, identifying trends and notable changes in preferences, especially in databases, platforms, and web frameworks, among developers.
