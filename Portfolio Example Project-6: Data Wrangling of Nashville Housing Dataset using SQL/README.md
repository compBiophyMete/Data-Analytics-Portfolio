**Situation:**

In the context of a project involving the Nashville Housing dataset, data cleaning was identified as a crucial step to enhance the quality and consistency of the data for subsequent analysis.

**Task:**

The task involved cleaning the dataset using SQL, addressing specific challenges and inconsistencies in the data.

**Action:**

*1. Standardizing the date format as YYYY-MM-DD:*
- Recognizing the importance of consistent date formats, a SQL query was employed to standardize all dates in the dataset to the format YYYY-MM-DD. This action ensured uniformity and facilitated accurate date-based analysis.
*2. Populating property address data based on Parcel ID and Unique ID:*
- To address missing or incomplete property address information, a SQL query was crafted to populate the relevant fields using data from Parcel ID and Unique ID. This action aimed to create a more comprehensive dataset.
*3. Splitting property address into individual columns of address and city:*
- Employing SQL, the property address was strategically split into distinct columns for address and city. This action enhanced the dataset's structure, providing a more granular view of location-related information for ease of analysis.
*4. Converting 'Y' and 'N' into 'Yes' and 'No' in the Sold as Vacant field:*
- Recognizing the need for clarity and consistency, a SQL transformation was applied to convert 'Y' and 'N' values in the Sold as Vacant field to 'Yes' and 'No', respectively. This action improved the interpretability of the data.
*5. Removing duplicates in the dataset:*
- To ensure data integrity, a SQL operation was executed to identify and remove duplicate records from the dataset. This action aimed to eliminate redundancy and maintain a unique set of data entries.
*6. Removing the TaxDistrict, PropertyAddress, and SaleDate columns:*
- Through SQL commands, specific columns such as TaxDistrict, PropertyAddress, and SaleDate were selectively removed from the dataset. This action was driven by the project's requirements, streamlining the dataset for more focused analysis.

**Result:**

The result of these SQL-based cleaning actions was a refined Nashville Housing dataset, characterized by standardized formats, complete address information, improved data structure, enhanced readability, and removal of redundancy. The dataset was now better prepared for subsequent stages of analysis or modeling in the project.
